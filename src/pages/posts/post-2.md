# Freelancing in Austin: How I Help Businesses Upgrade Their WordPress Sites

I'm Joan, a freelance WordPress developer from France currently living in **Austin, Texas** for a few months. My goal? To help local businesses **improve their online presence** with fast, SEO-friendly, custom-built websites — no bloated templates, no page builders.

## Why Austin?

Austin is bursting with creativity and entrepreneurship. From local restaurants to clinics and boutiques, many businesses **still run outdated websites** — slow to load, non-responsive, or hard to update.

That’s where I come in.

## What I Offer

✅ Custom WordPress themes — from scratch  
✅ Advanced Custom Fields for flexible content  
✅ Multilingual setup (WPML)  
✅ SEO-optimized code  
✅ Accessibility-first design (WCAG compliant)  
✅ Mobile-first, responsive layouts  
✅ Pixel-perfect integration from Figma or Adobe XD  
✅ Plugin development (like [AJAX search autocomplete](https://github.com/Papamundodev/AJAX_search-_autocomplete))

## My Approach

Unlike agencies or template-based services, I work one-on-one with clients to build **tailor-made websites** that perform well, load fast, and are easy to manage.

I recently helped:
- **Eastside Clinic** modernize their clinic site with improved performance and design
- **Tourisme AirCorsica** create a sleek, SEO-optimized landing page
- **APDP Monaco** migrate from Prestashop to WordPress with a clean, modern interface

## Let’s Talk

💸 I’m currently offering **discounted first-project rates** for Austin-based businesses to build trust and start relationships.

If your site needs a refresh — or if you’re building something from scratch — I’d love to chat over coffee or Zoom. I’m here in Austin for a few more weeks and would be happy to meet in person.

📬 Reach out at [joan909fernandez@gmail.com](mailto:joan909fernandez@gmail.com)  
🌐 Portfolio: [https://eastside-clinic.com/](https://eastside-clinic.com/)

Let’s build something great — fast, affordable, and future-proof.
