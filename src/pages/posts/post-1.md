# From Web Integrator to UX/UI Designer: My Transition Journey

As a web integrator and WordPress developer for the past five years, I’ve always been deeply involved in how websites *look* and *feel*. Working with custom themes, design systems, and accessibility has naturally led me to explore something I now find incredibly exciting: **UX/UI design**.

## Why UX/UI?

Over the years, I’ve realized that design is more than just making things beautiful — it's about crafting **functional, accessible, and human-centered digital experiences**. Whether I’m building a responsive site from scratch or tweaking a client’s layout, I’ve always thought in terms of the user journey. This curiosity led me to dig deeper into UX research, wireframing, and interface psychology.

## Skills I’m Bringing with Me

- ✅ **HTML/CSS mastery** with accessibility best practices (WCAG/RGAA)
- ✅ **Design system implementation** (atomic design, tokens)
- ✅ **Responsive design** across all devices
- ✅ **Figma & Adobe XD** prototyping
- ✅ **SEO knowledge** that supports better user navigation and indexing

## What I’m Learning Now

I’m currently expanding my knowledge in:
- 🧠 **User research** & empathy mapping
- 📐 **Information architecture** & user flows
- 🧪 **UX testing tools** (like Maze, Hotjar)
- 📝 **UX documentation & case studies**
- 🎨 **UI animation** with Framer & Lottie

## Why It Matters

I believe that combining **solid technical integration skills** with **UX thinking** makes me a better designer and a more complete web professional. My goal isn’t to abandon dev — it’s to bridge design and code even better.

If you’re looking for someone who can bring your product to life **from wireframe to deployment**, I’d love to connect!

👉 Let’s build something people love to use.
